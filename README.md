This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to the Obesity dataset using K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means. It analyzes clustering behavior using different feature combinations, evaluates cluster quality using the Dunn Index, and compares hard vs. soft clustering approaches. Experiments include k from 2–10, feature expansion with CALC (diet), FAF (physical activity), and CH2O (hydration). Results show that K-Means with k=8 and five features (Age, Height, Weight, CALC, FAF) yields the best compactness and separation, while FCM produces smoother but less distinct clusters when hardened. Visualizations and detailed interpretations are provided.
